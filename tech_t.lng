"Nuclear_Fission_NAME" LANG "Nuclear Fission Weapons"
"Nuclear_Fission_DESC" LANG "A fission weapon is the most rudimentary type of nuclear bomb. Fission weapons work by starting a nuclear chain reaction within a fissile fuel source such as enriched uranium or plutonium. This chain reaction rapidly splits atoms within the fissile material into smaller elements and releases a tremendous amount of energy in the process, which results in an extremely powerful explosion and a release of deadly ionizing radiation and radioactive material. The fission process is also instrumental as the first stage in fusion-based weapons, so an understanding of basic fission will pave the way for drastically more powerful weapons as well.
Unlocks first-generation nuclear weapons, which do massive damage to enemy units and can inflict thousands of casualties in an instant.
Now you are become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

"THERMONUCLEAR_BOMB_NAME" LANG "Early Thermonuclear Weapons"
"THERMONUCLEAR_BOMB_DESC" LANG "Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei fuse into heavier elements, releasing even more energy than in a fission reaction of the same mass. Using a two-stage process, a fission explosion can be used to compress a fusion fuel source and create the conditions necessary for fusion, which then produces an even larger secondary explosion. Fusion weapons also have an advantage in that unlike pure fission weapons, which become unstable when they reach a certain size, there is no theoretical limit to how large a fusion bomb can be.
Unlocks early thermonuclear weapons, which have substantially greater blast yields and can be used in basic MIRVs."

"Tactical_nukes_NAME" LANG "Tactical Nuclear Weapons"
"Tactical_nukes_DESC" LANG "Although nuclear weapons are obviously very potent as a means of destroying a target, most military taskings don’t require the destructive power of a full-sized countervalue weapon, as well as the inevitable collateral damage that comes with it. After overcoming the challenges of creating a compact nuclear warhead, relatively low-yield, light nuclear weapons were developed for use against massed formations on the battlefield, rather than against cities or strategic targets.
Unlocks a variety of low-cost, low-yield nuclear weapons suitable for counterforce attacks."


"Mega-warheads_NAME" LANG "Boosted Fission Stages" 
"Mega-warheads_DESC" LANG "Although early fusion tests delivered incredible explosive yields, the devices that delivered them were inefficient and very large. The initial fission stage of a thermonuclear bomb can be boosted by using a small amount of fusion to produce neutrons, which then cause even more nuclear chain reactions and greatly speed up the fission process, which results in a higher blast yield. Making the tamper between the fission and fusion stages out of fissile material allows it to act as fuel, releasing even more energy. These improvements, along with a few others, allow for the construction of lighter, more efficient and more dangerous weapons.
Allows for the construction of more powerful thermonuclear weapons, with greater blast yields and the potential to be used in enhanced MIRV designs."


"Advanced_Tactical_nukes_NAME" LANG "Advanced Tactical Nuclear Weapons"
"Advanced_Tactical_nukes_DESC" LANG "Not all tactical nuclear weapons are equal. Large weapons with limited guidance such as nuclear artillery shells and short-range ballistic missiles are relatively simple and easy to produce. However, more technical designs such as nuclear air-to-air missiles and ABMs require more finesse and expertise in order to be practical and functional. Advancements in warhead miniaturization and the development of new ad-hoc designs will pave the way for these specialized weapons.
Unlocks more tactical nuclear weapon designs. Increases the lethality and precision of nuclear artillery."

"Cobalt_Bomb_NAME" LANG "Cobalt Bombs"
"Cobalt_Bomb_DESC" LANG "A cobalt bomb is a hypothetical 'salted' nuclear weapon. When cobalt is exposed to the neutrons released in a thermonuclear explosion, it is converted into a highly radioactive isotope that emits dangerous levels of radiation for decades. A thermonuclear bomb coated in cobalt would produce fallout that would persist and stay lethal for dozens of years, making it far more dangerous and damaging than a similar unsalted weapon.
Cobalt bombs produce higher casualties and much more fallout compared to weapons of similar yields. The enhanced fallout will also cause immediate casualties in cities that are not directly hit by the blast."

"Enhanced_Salted_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Enhanced Salted Weapons"
"Enhanced_Salted_Weapons_DESC" LANG "Ordinary cobalt bombs have the potential to end the world, but enhancing their radiological effects allows them to do even more damage. The short-term effects of a cobalt bomb can be amplified by adding materials like sodium, zinc, gold or tantalum, which have shorter half-lives and expend their radioactive energy more quickly, giving people less time to seek shelter before they absorb a fatal dose of radiation. Sufficiently high levels of radiation can penetrate shielding, causing casualties in shelters that would have otherwise been safe. Further improvements can be made by maximizing the amount of contaminating material, optimizing its transmutation into radioactive isotopes, and detonating in a way that maximizes fallout dispersion. Such weapons would have the contaminating potential to pose a grave and dire threat to the entire biosphere, and could render huge swathes of land dangerously radioactive or utterly uninhabitable for decades. There is no purpose for such a weapon other than as a tool of spite and reprisal.
Replaces basic cobalt bombs with enhanced versions that release more pollution and cause more casualties. Be warned, the fallout will be overwhelming!"


"Advanced_Multi-Stage_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Advanced Multi-Stage Weapons"
"Advanced_Multi-Stage_Weapons_DESC" LANG "The latest generation of nuclear missiles can deliver multiple high-yield warheads at once, which means that even a single MIRV has enough firepower to obliterate a small country. In order to achieve such destructive power, measures need to be taken to maximize the efficiency and power of each individual warhead as well as reduce their physical footprints so they fit inside the delivery system. By using high quality, highly-enriched fuels, eliminating unnecessary weight and making design improvements to maximize the efficiency of the fission and fusion reactions, it will be possible to build practically sized weapons with even more destructive power. Additionally, developing the technology to make warheads more elongated or ‘egg-shaped’ without diminishing their blast yield will make it possible to fit more of them into a single weapons package. Together, these improvements will make it both feasible and practical to develop and deploy a new generation of thermonuclear weapons with utterly nightmarish potential.
Allows for the construction of advanced nuclear weapon designs, with extremely high blast yields. Also allows for the development of the most sophisticated MIRV designs."

"Pure_Fusion_Weapon_NAME" LANG "Pure Fusion Weapons"
"Pure_Fusion_Weapon_DESC" LANG "A theoretical type of weapon, a pure-fusion weapon would rely entirely on nuclear fusion to generate energy. Such weapons would be lighter and more destructive compared to regular nuclear weapons, resulting in payloads with more raw destructive power. Although pure fusion releases dangerous ionizing radiation, unlike fission it does not produce any long-lived radioactive byproducts, making it less liable to contaminate the environment with dangerous radioactive fallout. However, the destruction caused by pure-fusion explosions will still raise particulate matter high into the upper atmosphere, contributing to nuclear winter and making the world less habitable.
Unlocks pure fusion weapons, which produce comparitively less fallout than other nuclear weapons and have unmatched raw destructive potential. Also upgrades all tactical nuclear weapons to cleaner, less polluting pure fusion versions, which can be used with greater impunity."


"Specialized_EMP_NAME" LANG "Specialized EMP Weapons"
"Specialized_EMP_DESC" LANG "Nuclear explosions release a burst of electromagnetic energy known as an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, which results in rapidly changing electric and magnetic fields that can damage and disable electronic equipment. At high altitudes, this EMP interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field and ionizes some of the atmosphere, which dramatically increases the EMP’s effects and range. Specialized high altitude EMP weapons, known as HEMPs, are nuclear weapons that explode at altitudes of around 400km in order to maximize this effect and knock out electrical infrastructure like communications and power grids. Although military equipment can be electrically shielded to protect against EMPs, most civilian electronics are vulnerable.
Unlocks EMP weapons, which will stun certain enemy units without electrical protection, as well dramatically affect the economic outputs of enemy cities within a wide radius. Stunned units will have no sensor capabilities, which prevents them from using weapons that require precise targeting."


"Super_EMP_NAME" LANG "Super EMP Weapons"
"Super_EMP_DESC" LANG "By capitalizing on the gamma ray component of the initial blast, optimizing the altitude of the detonation and simply using more efficient weapons, it’s possible to amplify the effects of a nuclear EMP even further. Enhanced, or ‘super’ EMPs create even higher voltages, resulting in more powerful disruptive effects over an even larger radius. The technical knowledge needed to create a super EMP also paves the way for new delivery methods.
Unlocks super EMPs with greater areas of effect, and allows for the construction of 10MT EMP ICBMs."

"Aircraft-launched_MRBM_NAME" LANG "Air-Launched Ballistic Missiles"
"Aircraft-launched_MRBM_DESC" LANG "Although the simplicity of gravity bombs allows them to have impressive explosive yields, their limited range endangers the aircraft delivering them, as they have to enter hostile airspace and avoid enemy defences and air patrols, as well as run from the raw explosive power of the bomb itself. Developing ballistic missiles that can be launched from an aircraft, and modifying existing bombers to be compatible with them, will allow bombers to deliver heavy payloads from stand-off distances, significantly increasing their odds of survival and allowing them to attack targets further from their bases. Air-launched ballistic missiles, or ALBMs, may have lower yields than large free-fall bombs, but offer considerably more strategic flexibility.
Unlocks conventional and nuclear ALBMs for long-range bombers, allowing them to attack from farther away."

"Aircraft-launched_ICBM_NAME" LANG "Aircraft Launched ICBM"
"Aircraft-launched_ICBM_DESC" LANG "Bombers will never be capable of firing missiles with the same heavy payloads as silo-based systems, but the ability to fire smaller ICBMs, similar to those used by road-mobile systems, can be achieved through extensive upgrades and modifications. Air-launched ICBMs, or AL-ICBMs, combine the strengths of both legs of the nuclear triad, and also allow for more strategic flexibility. AL-ICBMs can bypass anti-missile defenses by attacking from unexpected angles, and unlike surface-based systems, can't be countered by simply nuking the launch site. However, AL-ICBMs offer less raw destructive power when compared to traditional high-yield gravity bombs or heavy silo-based missiles, and may be less cost-effective.
Allows strategic bombers to launch the same missiles as ICBM vehicles."

+ Can target enemy naval vessels.
+ Inexpensive to produce.
+ Can be repositioned.
+ Air-deployable from transport planes.
- Can only target submarines when surfaced.
- Can only attack naval targets."

"COASTAL_DEFENCE_NAME" LANG "Coastal Missile Batteries"
"COASTAL_DEFENCE_DESC" LANG "Since the earliest days of naval warfare, using land-based projectile weapons against enemy warships has been instrumental in defending coasts and shorelines. Prior to the cold war, the role of coastal defence was performed by immobile, large caliber guns firing heavy shells. However, as naval weaponry advanced and became more accurate and responsive over long distances, stationary guns became vulnerable, ineffective and ultimately obsolete. As a result, they have been supplanted by mobile systems capable of repositioning to avoid enemy fire. The guns themselves have also been replaced in favour of guided anti-ship missiles, which are deadlier, more accurate and more capable of defeating the defences of modern warships.
Unlocks land-based coastal missile batteries, which fire anti-shipping missiles from land.
Partially unlocks light AShMs, for use by naval helicopters and naval monitoring stations."

+ Can fire at enemy units.
- Easy to destroy and immobile.
- Relatively ineffective firepower."

"M_Coastal_Gun_Old_NAME" LANG "Anti-Ship Gun"
"M_Coastal_Gun_Old_DESC" LANG "A large-caliber, unguided coastal anti-ship gun firing heavy shells. Used by coastal gun sites."

"Air_to_Air_Missile_NAME" LANG "Early Infrared Air-to-Air Missiles"
"Air_to_Air_Missile_DESC" LANG "Gun-based weapons were the only practical options for air-to-air combat until the first air-to-air missiles arrived, and their introduction revolutionized aerial combat. Using primitive infrared (colloquially known as heatseeking) guidance, early air-to-air missiles could lock onto the hot exhaust from enemy planes and home in on them and explode. Despite these early missiles having relatively low accuracy, limited seeker ranges and an inability to attack from any direction other than behind, acquiring a missile lock is much easier than following the target and lining up a gun kill, so missiles rapidly came to dominate the air-to-air battlefield.
Unlocks air-to-air missiles, which are a necessity to be effective in aerial combat and a prerequisite to develop interceptor aircraft."

"AAM_Improved_NAME" LANG "All-Aspect AAMs"
"AAM_Improved_DESC" LANG "Early air-to-air missiles were limited in their capabilities, primarily due to their relatively poor guidance systems. Generally using unsophisticated infrared homing, these missiles had trouble locking onto targets or maintaining locks. By improving the field of view and range of the seeker heads and giving them the sophistication needed to attack a target from any angle instead of just the rear, the probability of an infrared missile successfully tracking and hitting its target increases considerably. The widespread adoption of longer-ranged semi-active radar guided missiles also meant that air-to-air engagements could start and finish from farther away.
Increases the accuracy, speed and range of air-to-air missiles."

"AAM_Enhanced_NAME" LANG "F&F Radar-Guided AAMs"
"AAM_Enhanced_DESC" LANG "As radar guidance improved, large, long-range fire-and-forget missiles began to proliferate in the aerial battlespace. Although air-to-air radar guided missiles have existed for a long time, the earlier models were semi-active, which means that the pilot had to keep the nose of their aircraft pointed towards the target in order to illuminate it with radar so the missile could home in on it. Newer models, conversely, have their own on-board radar and can find targets on their own without the launch aircraft’s assistance. Effective long-range fire-and-forget systems meant that pilots could reliably start combat from extreme distances and begin evasive maneuvers well before they entered visual range, and could often score kills without ever actually seeing their target. Of course, shorter-ranged missiles still retained their place, and continuously became more agile and harder to fool, and as a result, deadlier.
Further increase the accuracy, speed and range of air-to-air missiles."

"AAM_Advanced_NAME" LANG "Off-Boresight Ramjet AAMs"
"AAM_Advanced_DESC" LANG "Information technology and better tracking would continue to make air-to-air missiles more precise and more deadly. High-level integration with the host aircraft and the pilot’s heads-up display system would allow missiles to be fired off-boresight at targets at wide angles far from the front of the aircraft, meaning pilots could often engage a target simply by turning their head to look at it and firing a missile. The flight characteristics of the missiles would also improve, especially with the adoption of ramjet propulsion, which is extremely effective at the high speeds encountered in air-to-air combat. Ramjet missiles generate large amounts of thrust efficiently when travelling at high speeds, allowing them to more rapidly close in on their targets and give them even less time to properly respond, often with deadly results.
Increases the accuracy, speed and range of air-to-air missiles even further."

"AAM_Experimental_NAME" LANG "Advanced Hybrid Guidance AAMs"
"AAM_Experimental_DESC" LANG "Out of necessity, the guidance system on an air-to-air missile can’t be very big, which puts limits on their sophistication and capabilities. The development of advanced miniaturized sensors and computing components will make it possible to fit more sensors into the head of a missile without degrading its performance in other aspects, allowing for the creation of smarter missiles that rely on multiple forms of guidance to improve their accuracy and resist countermeasures. Combinations of radar, electro-optical and infrared tracking will ensure that AAMs always find their targets, and improved targeting and tracking software will allow them to fuse information from their sensors to form a higher resolution ‘image’ of the target. In essence, missiles with hybrid guidance have an even better idea of where their targets will be, do not suffer from the shortcomings of any one guidance system, and are even harder to fool, making them extremely accurate and likely to score kills. As a benefit of this extra precision, they are also capable of hitting their targets much faster and much harder.
Increase the range of air-to-air missiles, and greatly increases their speed and destructive power."

"M_Heli_ATGM_NAME" LANG "Helicopter ATGM"
"M_Heli_ATGM_DESC" LANG "A short range anti-tank air-to-ground missile used by attack helicopters. Intended to destroy armored vehicles, but can easily be repurposed to attack any other nearby targets."

"M_Anti-Radiation_Missile_NAME" LANG "Anti-Radar Missile"
"M_Anti-Radiation_Missile_DESC" LANG "An anti-radiation missile (ARM) used by electronic warfare aircraft to counteract enemy air defences. It has better range and performance compared to other AGMs, but can only attack targets with strong radio emissions. This includes fixed and mobile SAM and radar sites, and enemy jamming vehicles. It will not be able to attack other targets."

"Air_to_Ground_missile_NAME" LANG "Early CLOS Air-to-Ground Weapons"
"Air_to_Ground_missile_DESC" LANG "Even as aerial warfare stepped into the jet age, dumbfire munitions like unguided bombs, rockets and guns were the only weapons readily available to attack ground targets, and their limited precision meant that pilots either had to accept being inaccurate, or get close to the target and endanger themselves while attempting to maneuver in to attack. The eventual invention of air-to-ground missiles and TV-guided bombs meant that aircraft finally had a means to accurately engage targets on the ground without having to strafe them or drop bombs at short range. Early AGMs and GBUs were generally not particularly effective and often used command-to-line-of-sight (CLOS) guidance, which required the pilot or a weapons officer to manually direct the munition to the target, but the advantages over unguided weapons and the potential for improvement were clear.
Unlocks AGMs for attack aircraft and GBUs for bombers, which are more effective against surface units and especially damaging against armies. Be warned, only sufficiently advanced aircraft will be able to use them!"

"Improved_AGM_NAME" LANG "Optically Guided AGMs"
"Improved_AGM_DESC" LANG "Manually guided missiles have obvious shortcomings, and so a fire-and-forget weapon for attack aircraft was desperately sought as a remedy. But the small ground targets that tactical AGMs were tasked against weren't easy to track with radar or infrared guidance, like what other early guided missiles had. Home-on-jam missiles could track radar-emitting targets like radars and SAMs, but they would not work against targets like tanks or other vehicles. It would be necessary to develop optically guided missiles that could identify targets based on their contrast with the ground and also visually identify movement, so contrast-seeking and electro-optical guided missiles were developed for the task. These missiles 'see' in the visible spectrum and pick out their targets based on contrast and changes in light levels, allowing them to seek targets like tanks and enemy installations by 'looking' at them and seeing if they stand out or move. Without the need for manual steering, these new missiles were able to move much faster and carry heavier payloads than their predecessors.
Greatly increases the accuracy and speed of AGMs. Slightly increases their range and damage.
Increases the accuracy and damage of GBUs.
Partially unlocks Anti-Radiation Missiles for EW aircraft, which are very good at destroying radars and SAMs.
Partially unlocks ALCMs, which are used by multirole aircraft and bombers."

"Enhanced_AGM_NAME" LANG "Specialized Precision AGMs"
"Enhanced_AGM_DESC" LANG "A wide variety of air-to-ground missiles would emerge, all with different guidance systems built for different purposes. To name a few, heatseeking infrared missiles would become smart enough to be effective against hot targets like active tanks in a fire-and-forget role, while laser guided munitions would be invaluable for precision strikes. As these systems evolved to reliably engage targets with high accuracy, new warheads were developed to maximize their effects for their roles, such as thermobaric weapons, which create an explosive cloud of gas that ignites and produces a huge shockwave, tandem shaped charges, which explode twice in the same spot to defeat reactive armour, and bunker busters, which can penetrate deep into hardened structures before detonating. These specialized weapons and their continuingly increasing precision would serve to raise the accuracy and destructive efficiency of AGMs and GBUs.
Greatly increases the damage and accuracy of AGMs. Slightly increases their range.
Greatly increases the accuracy and damage of GBUs. Also provides a range increase.
Increases the damage and accuracy of ALCMs."

"Advanced_AGM_NAME" LANG "Autonomous Active Tracking AGMs"
"Advanced_AGM_DESC" LANG "The continuous improvements to tactical missile guidance would eventually lead to a point where even relatively small anti-tank missiles could be fired from long-range and autonomously hunt and kill enemy assets. Highly advanced miniature sensors would allow missiles to find and track targets without the help of their host aircraft, and then sophisticated onboard AI could then determine the nature of the target, whether or not to attack it, and even the best place to hit it to score a kill, similar to multi-million dollar cruise missiles taking on large high-value targets like bunkers, except now on a much smaller and less expensive scale. With this technology, aircraft can strike from stand-off or near-stand-off distances even with relatively small weapons, allowing them to do considerable damage without putting themselves in harm's way. Although earlier AGMs could technically do this to an extent, they lacked the sophistication to do it reliably without risking serious collateral damage or friendly fire.
Significantly increases the range and accuracy of AGMs.
Greatly increases the range of GBUs and improves their accuracy.
Increases the damage and accuracy of ALCMs."

"Experimental_AGM_NAME" LANG "Neural Network Trained AGMs"
"Experimental_AGM_DESC" LANG "The most pressing challenges faced by advanced AGMs is their initial target acquisition as well as overcoming any defences that the target might have, like electronic countermeasures and soft and hard kill active protection systems. By developing advanced algorithms using machine learning, air-to-ground missiles can be 'taught' how to better recognize enemy targets, evaluate their importance, and choose an attack vector to both maximize the damage done to the target and minimize the risk of being intercepted. Training the missiles appropriately will also allow them to maneuver more precisely and identify targets from further away, increasing their speed and effective range. With these measures in place, air-to-ground missiles will be highly autonomous, making them effectively immune to jamming and very difficult to defeat, while their improved performance in other areas will allow them to reliably attack from extreme distances and strike with stunning speed and precision.
Increases the accuracy, range, damage and speed of AGMs. Reduces their odds of being intercepted.
Increases the accuracy, range and damage of GBUs.

Ballistic missiles are launched to a high altitude and then fall in an arc down towards their targets. The earliest examples of guided ballistic missiles were seen in WWII, where they were launched from above-ground rocket sites. Although comparatively short-ranged and inaccurate compared to modern weapons, early ballistic missiles were valued as they offered the unique ability to attack a target from hundreds of miles away, while also being impossible to stop after being launched. The potential for these weapons to evolve was quickly realized, and with the advent of nuclear bombs, nuclear ballistic missiles were seen as the obvious next terrifying step forward.

Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles, also known as MRBMs, are a classification of missiles designed to be used against targets at ‘medium’ range, which in this context could mean distances out to 3,000km away. Their increased size and power makes them more capable than earlier ballistic missiles and SRBMs, and their focus on longer-range targets means they often have larger payloads to offset the loss of accuracy over long distances, giving them greater potential for counter-value attacks against enemy cities. They are also considerably smaller and simpler than full-sized ICBMs, which gives them more flexibility and lower production costs.
MRBMs are ideal as a powerful counterforce weapon that can be wielded in large quantities, and also have the potential to destroy enemy cities within range."

This created a demand for a road-mobile ICBM capability, which would have to be fulfilled using massive multi-axle vehicles powered by heavy diesel engines. Even so, the heavier ICBMs would remain relegated to silos, but now lighter ICBMs could go anywhere the road could take them.
Unlocks mobile ICBM launch vehicles, capable of using light ICBMs."

Although mobile launchers would naturally never be able to compete with fixed sites in terms of raw missile throw weight, these improved TEL systems would allow for increased mobility to aid in their survival. Improving the launch system itself and its supporting elements would also make it possible to rearm and fire a second missile in less time, though that time may be better spent driving away from the inevitable retaliation strike speeding towards the launch site...

Although heavy ICBMs are still and always will be out of the question, lighter ICBMs are more mobile and easier to hide than ever, which can be especially disconcerting considering what modern road-mobile systems are capable of. Of course, the lighter short and medium-range missile carriers have also benefitted from these advances.

"Improved_Inertial_Guidance_NAME" LANG "Improved Inertial Guidance"
"Improved_Inertial_Guidance_DESC" LANG "Early ballistic missiles were very imprecise and lacked the accuracy to reliably engage small point targets like military bases, or launch silos, which means that these targets had to be serviced by bombers or shorter-range weapons instead. This problem would eventually be alleviated by improving the guidance and correction systems of the missiles. Inertial guidance is a process in which a missile determines its location and direction by tracking its own movements and deducing where it must be as a result. In essence, it’s how a missile knows where it is by knowing where it was, where it’s going, and where it’s supposed to be. Better inertial guidance systems will allow ballistic missiles to more accurately track and correct their flight paths, allowing them to explode closer to their intended targets and inflict more damage to them.
Without this technology, ballistic missiles won't be able to efficiently or reliably destroy hardened point targets like air bases or army bases unless they're using very large warheads, but will still do full damage to cities. Make sure you invest in this technology if you're planning on using your ballistic missiles for counterforce strikes!

MARVs are not capable of radical maneuvers like hypersonic glide vehicles, but their increased accuracy and rudimentary tracking are welcome improvements. MARVs are most practical on medium-range systems like SLBMs and MRBMs being used against military targets.
Increases the accuracy of unitary SLBMs, MRBMs and SRBMs, and makes them slightly more difficult to intercept."

"Advanced_Inertial_Guidance_NAME" LANG "Advanced Inertial Guidance"
"Advanced_Inertial_Guidance_DESC" LANG "In order to reliably destroy hardened targets like silos and bunkers in a single strike, nuclear weapons would have to be able to consistently land within a few hundred meters of their targets or better. Refined inertial guidance systems with more sophisticated instrumentation and secondary corrective tracking measures would be necessary to minimize the error in the missile's calculated position and trajectory. More finely-tuned control thrusters would allow inertially guided weapons to make more precise adjustments, and eventually develop to a point where their warheads could reliably detonate within mere dozens of meters from their target even after travelling hundreds or thousands of kilometers. As a result, missiles that use this technology can guarantee the destruction of a static target anywhere on Earth, provided the warhead is powerful enough and there are no missile defences available to stop them.
Luck is leaving the equation. Where nuclear weapons are concerned, there is no longer such a thing as a near miss, and even relatively low-yield missiles will reliably destroy hardened silos. 
Further increases the accuracy of all ballistic missiles."

The same rockets that were used to pioneer humankind’s leap into space were the same rockets that would form the base for the world’s earliest intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. An ICBM is a large ballistic missile that is launched high into the atmosphere and travels thousands of miles before arriving at its target. The earliest ICBMs were huge, primitive and inefficient, and had to be fired from complex space-launch facilities. They were bulky, expensive, cumbersome and inaccurate, but they were also the first weapons to provide nuclear superpowers a means to easily destroy targets anywhere on Earth within minutes. Thanks to these weapons, nowhere on Earth is safe.
Unlocks ICBM launchpads, which can fire heavy ICBMs."

The trend of miniaturization meant that ICBMs could now be launched from underground silos, which are easier to conceal and more survivable than launchpads, and from special mobile launchers, which have the advantage of being able to relocate to engage targets more effectively, and avoid being destroyed.
Unlocks light ICBMs, which are cheaper, reload faster and can be launched from silos and mobile launchers."

"Solid_Fuel_Rockets_NAME" LANG "Solid Fuel Rocket Systems"
"Solid_Fuel_Rockets_DESC" "The first ballistic missiles used liquid fuel, which has some disadvantages. Although it offers more control and better performance, liquid fuel settles and degrades if left unattended for too long, which means that liquid-fuelled rockets can’t hold their fuel for long periods and are only fuelled in anticipation for a launch. Liquid fuel is also more volatile and dangerous to work with, creating the potential for accidents. This makes it less suitable for military applications than solid fuel. Solid fuel rockets aren’t as powerful as liquid rockets, but they can be launched with minimal preparation and are safer and more reliable. Improved solid fuel rockets are sufficient for the purposes of ballistic missile launches, and are also much more practical, and can be used in a wider variety of applications.
Reduces the production costs of SLBMs, MRBMs, SRBMs, ALBMs and Lightweight ICBMs, without degrading their performance.
Reduces the set-up time for ICBM and all Ballistic Missile TEL Vehicle launches. Consider investing in this technology if you want to ensure your units can fire before they're destroyed in a first strike!"

Rocket propellants were improved to offer more thrust per unit of mass and engineering improvements on the rockets themselves serve to eliminate unnecessary weight and increase performance and efficiency. As a result, weapons originally delivered by heavy rockets which were confined to launchpads, can now be delivered by silo-based systems. This improved rocket technology also increases the maximum potential range of all ICBMs, and also paves the way for some particularly potent and sophisticated ICBM designs…
Allows missile silos to fire heavy ICBMs, similar to ICBM Launchpads. Increases the range of all ICBMs."

"False_warheads_NAME" LANG "Penetration Aids"
"False_warheads_DESC" LANG "The advent of anti-ballistic missiles meant that there was finally a tool that could challenge the formerly unstoppable power of a ballistic missile strike. To counteract this, measures were developed to confuse anti-missile defences and protect ballistic warheads from interception. Devices like chaff countermeasures, decoy warheads and cooling shrouds were developed to obscure nuclear missiles in flight and increase the odds of the warhead reaching its target without being destroyed first. Fielding these measures adds additional weight to the weapons package, which has to be offset with weight-reducing compromises, reduced range or additional thrust, making them most effective on heavier platforms. However, they can serve to overwhelm enemy ABM defences and make landing a successful hit considerably easier.
Passively decreases the chances of friendly ballistic missiles being shot down slightly.
Adds a small number of decoy warheads to ICBM MIRVs. Decoys won't be targeted by terminal ABMs, but can help overwhelm midcourse ABM systems."

"MIRV_NAME" LANG "MIRV"
"MIRV_DESC" LANG "A Multiple Independently-Targetable Reentry Vehicle, or MIRV, is a system that allows multiple nuclear warheads to be deployed by a single missile. During the midcourse phase of the missile’s trajectory, the grouped warheads separate from the bus stage of the rocket and drop towards their targets, in a way similar to a cluster bomb. MIRVs have an advantage over unitary rockets in that they can deliver more warheads at once with fewer launchers, making them useful for overwhelming ballistic missile defences while also being more efficient against massed targets like cities. Although the design of MIRVs necessitates smaller warheads than in a regular unitary missile, several smaller spread-out nukes will tend to do more damage than a single large one, conferring a destructive advantage. However, MIRVs require extensive technical knowledge to design and are considerably more expensive to produce.
Unlocks basic MIRVs, which release several nuclear warheads after being launched."

"Improved_MIRV_NAME" LANG "Enhanced MIRVs"
"Improved_MIRV_DESC" LANG "The first MIRV missiles could only deliver 3 warheads at once due to the bulkiness of the warheads, their guidance packages and the components of the MIRV bus that releases them. However, improvements in MIRV technology would size these components down and make it possible to fit more warheads into smaller spaces, and increase the destructive potential of MIRVs by improving their warhead count. Smaller, more sophisticated MIRV systems meant that it would also be possible to implement downsized versions on light, road-mobile ICBMs, instead of relegating them to heavy systems like silo-based ICBMs or shorter-ranged weapons like SLBMs.
Increases the warhead count for MIRVs, and unlocks light ICBM MIRVs for mobile launchers."


"Novel_BM_Light_NAME" LANG "Novel Light Ballistic Missiles"
"Novel_BM_Light_DESC" LANG "Further development in missile and warhead technology has the potential to lead to SLBMs and MRBMs with more destructive power.

"Hypersonic_Maneuvering_NAME" LANG "Hypersonic Maneuvering"
"Hypersonic_Maneuvering_DESC" LANG "Projectiles moving at speeds greater than Mach 5 are said to be ‘hypersonic’. Hypersonic flight is complicated by the intense amount of friction and heat produced as well as the properties of the airflow surrounding the object. As a result, maneuvering an object in the air at hypersonic speeds is a very challenging engineering problem, which requires extremely heat-resistant materials, complex propulsion systems designed for extreme speeds, and highly sophisticated and specialized aerodynamic designs. Mastering hypersonic maneuvering is useful for military applications, as it allows for the creation of hypersonic weapons, which are extremely dangerous, give the enemy little time to react and are nearly impossible to intercept and destroy without cutting-edge defences.
This technology will make it possible to develop hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles."


"Hypersonic_Glide_Vehicles_NAME" LANG "Hypersonic Glide Vehicles"
"Hypersonic_Glide_Vehicles_DESC" LANG "Hypersonic glide vehicles, or HGVs, offer a potential means to deliver nuclear warheads in a way similar to regular ballistic missiles, except with a much better chance of defeating missile defence systems. Similar to a ballistic warhead, HGVs are launched high into the atmosphere by a powerful rocket and then drop towards their targets at extreme speeds. However, while normal warheads simply follow a predictable ballistic trajectory, HGVs can glide in the atmosphere and maneuver before hitting their targets. Since they can actively change their course mid-flight, it's impossible to precisely predict their flight path, which makes them extremely difficult to intercept.
Due to their bulkier construction, demanding engineering requirements and prohibitingly high costs, HGVs are most practical on large unitary warheads, since MIRVs are already more capable of overwhelming missile defences.
Upgrades all heavy unitary ICBMs into HGV versions, which are much harder to shoot down once the glide vehicle has been deployed."

Other forms of guidance like infrared tracking would follow not long afterwards, but with limitations of their own. As electronics became more sophisticated, the effectiveness of guided missiles would improve, but the first generation was not particularly effective.

The first generation of cruise missiles had poor accuracy and were only suitable against large area targets, but they offered much greater range over other weapons, had the potential be launched from a variety of platforms and offered a means of hitting large targets like airports or bases from stand-off distances, which was especially viable if the cruise missiles were nuclear-tipped and accuracy was less of an issue. Much of the technology used in cruise missiles would also converge with anti-ship weapons, and lead to long-range anti-ship missiles.
Unlocks cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles.
Early cruise missiles lack the precision to reliably hit small targets like ships, but are useful against large land targets. Early anti-ship missiles can accurately hit enemy warships but have limited range until they are upgraded."

"Improved_cruise_missiles_NAME" LANG "Precision Cruise Missiles"
"Improved_cruise_missiles_DESC" LANG "The biggest shortcoming with early cruise missiles was their lack of precision. Although they were effective against large targets (for example, terror-bombing cities like their earliest predecessors) they were unable to service anything that required any degree of accuracy. The development of terminal guidance systems and finer control systems would make it possible for cruise missiles to identify their targets and adjust their course to hit them, allowing them to reliably destroy large point targets like ships, bridges and buildings. This development would also lead to early anti-ship missiles being supplanted by specialized cruise missiles, with much better range, as well as the earliest, most rudimentary air-launched cruise missiles.
Greatly increases the accuracy and effectiveness of cruise missiles. Greatly increases the range of anti-ship missiles.
Partially unlocks ALCMs, which are used by multirole aircraft and bombers."

"Enhanced_cruise_missiles_NAME" LANG "Evasive Hybrid Guidance Cruise Missiles"
"Enhanced_cruise_missiles_DESC" LANG "As cruise missiles continued to be upgraded, improvements to their range, speed and accuracy were a given, but one of the most pressing issues of all was their ability to avoid being intercepted by constantly evolving CIWS and anti-missile defences. To counter these new systems, cruise missiles would adopt upgrades like satellite navigation and advanced terrain contour matching (TERCOM) to fly closer to the ground before hitting their targets, or actively maneuvering and attacking from high angles to confuse missile defense systems. By making cruise missiles 'smarter' and more aware of their surroundings, they can bypass missile defences more easily and hit their targets with greater accuracy.
Cruise and anti-ship missiles are now significantly harder to intercept and more accurate. Slightly improves the speed and range of cruise missiles and AShMs.
Increases the range, speed and evasiveness of ALCMs."

"Advanced_cruise_missiles_NAME" LANG "Advanced Stand-Off Cruise Missiles"
"Advanced_cruise_missiles_DESC" LANG "The latest models of cruise missiles leverage continuous technological improvements to increase their utility and lethality. Sophisticated engines and aerodynamics allow cruise missiles to travel even farther and faster, while improved guidance and command systems allow them to compete with ever-improving missile defence systems and hit their targets with pinpoint accuracy. Because they can reliably score direct hits on relatively small targets, a renewed emphasis has been given to their destructive power, and specialized conventional warheads have been developed to allow them to penetrate and destroy hardened targets like bunkers. Cruise missiles with these characteristics can generally attack from stand-off distances with impunity, as they're likely to destroy their targets and operate at ranges where retaliation isn't generally a concern, unless of course the enemy is operating similar weapons, or something very escalatory and conspicuous like ballistic missiles.

"Experimental_cruise_missiles_NAME" LANG "Hypersonic Cruise Missiles"
"Experimental_cruise_missiles_DESC" LANG "Cruise missiles travelling at upwards of 5 times the speed of sound, or at 'hypersonic' speeds, have a number of advantages. They can destroy time-sensitive targets very quickly, they are extremely difficult to shoot down, give little warning of their arrival, and can do serious damage to a target even without exploding. However, designing weapons to travel at hypersonic speeds comes with unique engineering challenges as the intense friction and behavior of the surrounding air creates dramatic complications. There's also the question of how to achieve hypersonic speeds in the first place. Although very expensive and difficult to design and build, hypersonic missiles are extremely dangerous and can effortlessly bypass all but the absolute best missile defence systems, making them brutally effective against priority targets.
Upgrades cruise and anti-ship missiles to hypersonic versions, which are extremely difficult to intercept without lasers and almost impossible to stop when used in salvoes."

"U_CARRIER_DESC" LANG "An aircraft carrier (or just carrier) is a large warship designed to carry combat aircraft and helicopters. Carriers have built-in runways and facilities to house and launch aircraft, and are crucial to providing air support for naval and marine operations. Because of their immense size, prestige and tactical and strategic importance, carriers have often been designated as the flagships for naval operations in the post-WWII environment. Carriers provide the ability to project air power anywhere in the world without relying on local facilities, and dramatically amplify the force projection capabilities of their fleets.

"Cruise_Missile_Submarine_DESC" LANG "Cruise missile submarines, or SSGs and SSGNs, are a derivative of traditional attack submarines. To compare the two, attack submarines tend to rely on their stealth and speed to defeat enemy ships using torpedoes, and can use cruise missiles to complement their anti-ship abilities or in a supplementary land attack role. SSGNs, on the other hand, are larger, slower and louder, but also come equipped with a substantial cruise missile payload, giving them the ability to devastate inland targets and destroy ships from stand-off distances, while still benefiting from the additional concealment that submarines enjoy. SSGNs can fire tactical nuclear weapons and are faster than SSBNs, but lack the ability to launch the full-scale SLBMs used to destroy cities.

An SSBN, also known as a ‘boomer’ is a nuclear-powered submarine armed with a complement of nuclear ballistic missiles. Since nuclear submarines can stay underwater at sea for months at a time and are very difficult to find and track, SSBNs are ideal for surviving a first strike and delivering surprise attacks, making them a crucial part of many retaliation-strike strategies. Early boomers were slow, loud, and could only sluggishly fire their weapons while surfaced, but having an invisible nuclear threat ready to strike at all times is an undeniable asset.

Their destructive capabilities would also have to improve, as their ability to provide a credible and grave threat is just as important as their survivability when it comes to providing nuclear deterrence. Upgraded weapon bays and launch systems will allow these SSBNs to carry more missiles and fire them faster, while improvements to the overall design and power and propulsion system allow for quieter running and deeper operating depths, making them harder to locate, and by extension, destroy.

The priorities of SSBN designs squarely became centered on ensuring that they could successfully deliver their payload, which meant further increasing their speed and stealth. Redesigned electrically driven propulsion systems would be central to this idea, as they would eliminate the need for noisy machinery and allow for faster, smoother and quieter travel. Although the quantity of weapons will stay on par with the previous generation, or in some cases even be reduced, improved fire control systems and new technology allows these new SSBNs to fire more quickly, reducing the time they spend vulnerable and maximizing how swiftly and fully they can annihilate their targets.

Stealth and survivability are still at the forefront of their designs, and although earlier SSBNs trended towards miniaturization and reduced firepower, size reductions in other areas and more compact launch systems will make it possible to fit more weapons into a smaller space and fire them more quickly, allowing SSBNs to present an ominous and inescapable danger even in the face of increasingly sophisticated missile defence systems. Theoretically, a sufficiently advanced submarine could launch its entire payload in just minutes, destroy an entire country and then escape back to the depths before anyone could realize what was happening.

Being able to stay underwater for extended periods of time while also never having to return to port or visit an oiler ship to refuel meant that suddenly, submarines could stay hidden at sea for months at a time and travel almost anywhere they wanted to. The strategic potential for ships that can lurk underwater almost indefinitely was quickly realized and nuclear power quickly came to dominate the realm of high performance submarines.
Increases the speed and capabilities of all attack submarines and SSGNs."

"Improved_Submarines_NAME" LANG "Improved Submarines"

Increases the speed, stealth and firepower of attack submarines and SSGNs."

"Missile_Warships_NAME" LANG "Missile-Armed Warships"
"Missile_Warships_DESC" LANG "Because of their tendency to attack large, high-priority targets, guided missiles are well-suited to the combat duties of surface warships. Once they proliferated after WWII, guided missiles rapidly replaced heavy guns on almost all newly built surface combatants. As a result, the overall design of warships began to focus more on mobility and sensors and less on heavy weapons and armour, as the new guided missile threat shifted the balance of power on the seas.
Allows cruisers and destroyers to use SAMs, CIWS, anti-ship missiles and anti-submarine rockets, if they are unlocked. Cruisers also gain access to nuclear cruise missiles, while destroyers gain conventional cruise missiles.
Increases the speed, survivability and fire rates of surface ships."

With the increasing accuracy and lethality of guided anti-ship missiles, it became increasingly apparent that heavy armour wasn’t going to be enough to keep ships from sinking under enemy fire, and was in fact starting to become a hindrance. Instead, the focus began to shift towards superior firepower and sensors to gain an offensive edge, as well as active protection systems like CIWS to stop enemy missiles from hitting their mark. Reduced armour loads and increased engine power made ships faster and more responsive as well. War on the high seas would continue to get smarter and smarter.
Improves the weapon loadouts of cruisers and destroyers.
Increases the speed, survivability and fire rates of surface ships."

"Enhanced_Warships_NAME" LANG "Modernized Ship Hulls"
"Enhanced_Warships_DESC" LANG "As time went on, it became unmistakably clear that in the age of guided missiles, the key to survival for surface warships is a combination of active protection, situational awareness, and deadly long-range firepower. Warships would become almost entirely dependent on electronic countermeasures and hard-kill defences like CIWS to survive incoming threats, while air support, long-range sensors and increasingly heavy missile armaments would be the tools of choice to hunt and kill other vessels, as well as support shoreside operations. Armor effectively became an afterthought but ships, especially carriers, would become bigger and heavier, since their physical size didn't affect their odds of being hit as much anymore. The ability to reposition and provide immense firepower became focal points for strategic flexibility, and so ships would become faster and more powerful to deliver devastation from the sea.
Increases the firepower of destroyers and cruisers, and also improves the speed and survivability of all warships."

"Advanced_Warships_DESC" LANG "Entirely new ship designs take a considerable amount of time to develop and then build, so in the interim before the first ultra-modern stealth ships came to be, older (but still extremely capable) ship designs would be gradually upgraded and modified to fill any capability gaps. These freshly upgraded ships also had the privilege of being the first ships to wield a suite of emerging new weapons, like railguns, high-powered lasers and anti-ballistic missile systems. Having these new tools at their disposal will allow warships to survive in an increasingly hostile battlespace, as threats like advanced anti-ship missiles and hypersonic weapons begin to proliferate, while also giving them renewed strategic importance as anti-satellite and missile defence platforms in the event of a nuclear war.

"Guided_Torpedoes_NAME" LANG "Guided Torpedoes"
"Guided_Torpedoes_DESC" LANG "Early torpedoes were straight-running and needed to lead their targets, which meant they required complex calculations, prior planning and a bit of luck to be used effectively. By fitting torpedoes with a guidance system that homes in on acoustic signatures or ship wakes, the probability of it finding, hitting and killing its target increases dramatically. Unsurprisingly, straight-running torpedoes were phased out shortly after guided torpedoes arrived, and depth charges were superseded by lightweight air-droppable torpedoes that filled the same role, but with the added benefit of chasing down their targets.
Greatly improves the accuracy and slightly increases the range of torpedoes."


"Improved_Underwater_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Improved Underwater Weapons"
"Improved_Underwater_Weapons_DESC" LANG "In order to counter the growing threat posed by nuclear submarines, new weapons were created to destroy them from long range. For example, Anti-Submarine Rockets travel through the air over long distances and then deploy homing torpedoes upon entering the water, while nuclear torpedoes destroy ships and submarines by crushing their hulls with intense underwater shockwaves. Of course, existing designs such as conventional and airdropped torpedoes have remained in use, but they have enjoyed incremental improvements such as upgraded motors and acoustic homing. These improved weapons are powerful tools for controlling the sea, but for them to be effective, it's important to have sonar equipment that can locate the enemy in the first place!

"Advanced_Underwater_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Advanced Underwater Weapons"
"Advanced_Underwater_Weapons_DESC" LANG "To counteract the growing effectiveness of submarine decoys and new quieting techniques, torpedoes with more effective target acquisition would be needed. Wide-frequency active sonar systems can search for targets more efficiently and are more resistant to countermeasures, allowing them to identify quieter and better-engineered submarines from longer distances and attack more efficiently. The destructive power of torpedoes would also increase, thanks to the development of new warheads that react violently when breached and exposed to water, creating larger explosions and massive thermal effects that can significantly damage ships even without scoring a direct hit.
Increases the range, speed, accuracy and damage of torpedoes."


"Experimental_Underwater_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Experimental Underwater Weapons"
"Experimental_Underwater_Weapons_DESC" LANG "The path for upgrading torpedoes in the future is largely centered around improved target acquisition. Submarines are comparably fragile targets and explosions are amplified underwater, so stopping power generally isn't a major issue. Submarines also don't have active protection systems, and aren't particularly well-suited to rapid maneuvering like a jet, for example, so their only dependable defences are their stealth as and a limited suite of sonic countermeasures and decoys. As a result, the greatest challenge with destroying a submarine is actually locating it and having a torpedo acquire it, so further improvements to the data link, acoustic homing and active sonar components of torpedoes take priority.

"Railguns_NAME" LANG "Railguns"
"Railguns_DESC" LANG "A railgun uses highly electrified rails to apply electromagnetic force to a heavy metal projectile and accelerate it to incredible speeds, upwards of 10,000 km/h. The sheer kinetic energy of an object travelling at that speed is enough to cause catastrophic damage on impact, so an explosive warhead isn’t needed. Despite facing technical challenges with barrel wear and power consumption, railguns offer advantages in that they’re cheaper to operate than guided missiles and offer greater destructive power and range over conventional ship guns. The extreme speed of the railgun shells also makes them nearly impossible to defend against and makes it much easier to lead and hit a target.
Replaces conventional ship guns with railguns, which are more accurate, longer-ranged and harder hitting. Can only be mounted on sufficiently advanced warships."

Although CIWS also refers to missile-based systems, the term is usually associated with ship-mounted gun systems, which generally consist of heavy rotary cannons that can fire exploding ammunition at thousands of rounds per minute at incoming threats. The basic principle is simple: if a missile defeats all of a ship’s countermeasures, the last resort is to pulverize it with a massive stream of gunfire and destroy it before it can hit the ship.

Warships are often threatened by cruise and anti-ship missiles, which are relatively large and easy to hit, and warships also innately have the tracking systems, electrical power and other provisions needed to operate CIWS effectively. However, CIWS would eventually expand beyond naval use, as advancements in targeting and radar systems would make it possible to intercept smaller targets like incoming rockets, artillery and mortars. As it also became more logistically feasible to set up the system on land to defend forward military bases, the concept of Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar, or C-RAM, was born.
Adds C-RAM to large airbases, army divisions, army bases, combat engineers and FOBs. C-RAM shoots down incoming projectiles similarly to a CIWS system."

Lasers are well-suited to the CIWS role, as they are effective at short range, travel at the speed of light and therefore have no lead time, and are powerful enough to quickly disable or destroy missiles. The main challenges with developing a laser CIWS system are building a laser powerful enough to reliably destroy its targets, and providing enough power to the laser for it to be effective.

Aircraft tend to be relatively soft targets with limited options for concealment, which in theory should make them easy targets for direct line-of-sight weapons like guns. However, guns have limited effectiveness because they have to lead their targets, and aircraft generally move very quickly, making them difficult to hit without using huge volumes of gunfire. Lasers on the other hand, reach their targets instantly, meaning they can reliably hit anything within their field of view. The lightweight construction of aircraft means that a sufficiently powerful laser should have no problems damaging or destroying one if it comes within visual range.

"Terminal_Defence_Laser_DESC" LANG "Extremely high-powered lasers that are capable of targeting incoming ballistic warheads can be used as the ultimate last-line of defence. The advantages of lasers make them extremely effective at destroying individual warheads, making them one of the few suitable defences against the emerging threats posed by hypersonic weapons. That being said, their comparatively limited range compared to missile based systems only gives them a small window of opportunity to intercept their targets, meaning they fare poorly against massed warheads. Still, their ability to reliably defend against any single warhead, namely heavy and hypersonic weapons, can make them an instrumental part of any missile defence network.
Unlocks Laser ABM trucks and complexes, which have limited range but can reliably destroy any type of missile, as long as the system isn’t overwhelmed by raw numbers. The fixed site is more effective and can destroy enemy satellites."

"Generation_2_Aircraft_NAME" LANG "2nd Generation Aircraft"
"Generation_2_Aircraft_DESC" LANG "Jet aircraft revolutionized aerial warfare perhaps more than any other development, and the second generation of jet aircraft would apply the hard lessons learned about this newly revolutionized battlespace. Second generation jets would see a pronounced shift from gun-based combat over to air-to-air missiles, which were far more suited to high-speed fighting. This generation of fighters would also see the first widespread use of built-in radars and afterburning engines capable of providing supersonic speeds. These new capabilities would also necessitate a trend of combat aircraft getting larger and heavier as they became more complex, sophisticated and powerful.

Allows attack aircraft to carry light nuclear weapons and AGMs."

"Generation_3_Aircraft_NAME" LANG "3rd Generation Aircraft"
"Generation_3_Aircraft_DESC" LANG "The third generation of fighter aircraft began to focus heavily on technological advantages to stay competitive in hostile airspace. Beyond-visual-range combat became a core focus of the capabilities for this generation, and the development of high-efficiency turbofan engines would extend the operational range of these craft. Although they would become slightly faster and more maneuverable, the emphasis on these traits would become more subdued as engagement distances grew, and within-visual-range combat and dogfighting began to fall out of favour. Instead, improved avionics, countermeasures and heavier weapon payloads would be prioritized.
Increases the speed, range and survivability of combat aircraft. Greatly increases their weapon payloads and allows them to fire more quickly."

"Generation_4_Aircraft_NAME" LANG "4th Generation Aircraft"
"Generation_4_Aircraft_DESC" LANG "Fourth generation aircraft continued the trend of extending their engagement ranges far into beyond-visual-range distances, and make use of a variety of technologies to that end. Digital avionics and fly-by-wire control systems would allow aircraft to fly smarter, while composite materials, advanced aerodynamics and almost ubiquitously twin-engined designs improved the physical performance of the airframes. Even though dogfights are seldom expected, 4th generation fighters are almost universally capable of sustained supersonic flight and high-G maneuvers, and some are capable of supermaneuverability. Many of these improvements were developed with the new advantages and threats posed by modern missile systems in mind, which helped mould the focus of their defensive and offensive capabilities.

Improvements like advanced avionics, conformal fuel tanks, modernized weapon systems and upgraded engines would help the fourth generation of fighters survive and thrive even as their original basic designs aged and became decades old. Despite the fact that many 4.5 generation aircraft have the same pedigree as their earlier counterparts, the cumulative upgrades that they enjoy make them considerably more capable than their predecessors.
Increases the range and survivability of combat aircraft, and allows them to fire their weapons more quickly."

"Generation_5_Aircraft_NAME" LANG "5th Generation Aircraft"
"Generation_5_Aircraft_DESC" LANG "The defining feature of fifth-generation fighters was their transition to stealth. Although stealth technology was used in earlier planes, they were bombers which were unwieldy to fly and had vastly different flight characteristics. Creating an aircraft capable of supersonic flight, high-G maneuvers and air-to-air combat while also retaining stealth features is a considerable challenge, as the balance between stealth and performance tends to counteract itself. Internal weapon bays, specialized coatings, finely-crafted radar-distorting airframes and extremely high-performing equipment are all crucial for stealth fighters to operate, which has made them extremely expensive and difficult to develop and manufacture.
Applies stealth technology to combat aircraft, making them much more difficult to find and engage. Also improves their other characteristics like range, survivability and weaponry."

"Generation_6_Aircraft_NAME" LANG "6th Generation Aircraft"
"Generation_6_Aircraft_DESC" LANG "Although the 6th generation of jet aircraft is not yet clearly defined, some common characteristics of the definition include improved stealth over the 5th generation, variable cycle engines offering higher cruise speeds and better maximum thrust, advanced sensor fusion and networking, and the ability to operate slaved drones and UAVs. Creating an airframe with all of these capabilities is an extremely challenging technical task, but the end result will be a generation of aircraft that is much more survivable and capable than any before it.
Increases the stealth capabilities of combat aircraft. Replaces aircraft autocannons with laser weapons. Also improves the other characteristics of the aircraft and their weapon loadouts."


"Generation_2_Bomber_NAME" LANG "Long-Range Bombers"
"Generation_2_Bomber_DESC" LANG "Although deploying nuclear weapons from bombers is viable, and in truth the only delivery method that’s been used in an actual attack, the very first nuclear-capable bombers had severe shortcomings in their survivability and operational range. Shortly after the advent of nuclear weapons, efforts were quickly put towards creating long-range bombers, as the most immediately pursuable means of deploying nuclear weapons against strategic targets. These new designs would dramatically change the realm of strategic bombing and remain in service for decades, as a simple and cost-effective means of delivering huge amounts of conventional ordnance, or nuclear weapons.
Improves strategic bombers, namely by dramatically increasing their range, providing them with radar, and enabling them to use weapons other than free-fall bombs."


"Generation_3_Bomber_NAME" LANG "Early Supersonic Bombers"
"Generation_3_Bomber_DESC" LANG "As aircraft and air defence systems evolved, bombers would have to evolve as well to stay relevant in the increasingly hostile strategic environment. Early developments resulted in a breed of fast, high-altitude bombers that were very capable over short distances, but were also very expensive to operate, required long runways and had limited range compared to their earlier counterparts. Although these short-comings would ultimately lead to their discontinuation, the ability to rapidly deliver a heavy payload by plane offered a degree of strategic value while other technologies matured, including the generation of bombers that would follow.
Unlocks High-Speed Bombers, which can only be launched from specialized air bases. High-speed bombers are faster than regular bombers but are also more expensive, can take less damage, only use gravity bombs and are initially shorter-ranged."

"Generation_4_Bomber_DESC" LANG "As engine technology and material science evolved, it became possible to create supersonic bombers that were capable of practical long-distance flights. Later generation supersonic bombers used variable geometry airframes to their advantage to maintain fuel-efficient flight at all speeds and ultimately offer a way to deliver heavy air power on shorter notice.
Increases the speed and survivability of long-range bombers. Dramatically increases the speed and range of high-speed bombers."

"Generation_5_Bomber_NAME" LANG "Stealth Bombers"
"Generation_5_Bomber_DESC" LANG "The element of surprise has always been a deciding factor in the success of an air raid. Although advanced radar and anti-air defences and interceptors made enemy airspace perilous to earlier bombers, the use of low-observable technology like radar-absorbing materials and complex low RCS designs lead to the first generation of stealth bombers. These bombers are much more difficult to detect and engage than their earlier counterparts, allowing them to easily bypass enemy defences through passive stealth rather than having to perilously rely on speed, complicated maneuvering and low-altitude flying.
Applies stealth technology to long-range bombers, making them much harder to detect and engage."

"Generation_6_Bomber_NAME" LANG "Advanced Stealth Bombers"
"Generation_6_Bomber_DESC" LANG "Stealth bombers can be developed even further thanks to advancements in aircraft design and material science. Improved radar-absorbing materials and advanced engines will allow late-generation stealth aircraft to carry their payloads over longer distances faster, and with less risk of being detected and shot down. Advanced stealth bombers are not invincible, especially if they can be found, but they can pose a serious threat to any opponent without an ironclad air defence network.
Increases the stealth capabilities and survivability of long-range bombers, making them much harder to detect and shoot down. Also increases their maximum flight range."

"Generation_7_Bomber_NAME" LANG "Sub-Orbital Bombers"
"Generation_7_Bomber_DESC" LANG "When the space shuttle was first unveiled, there were genuine fears that its true purpose was to drop nuclear bombs from space where it would be immune to air defences. Though this clearly wasn't the case, the original philosophy of high-speed bombers being taken to its logical conclusion could lead to something similar. The advent of extremely high-performing aircraft capable of high-supersonic or hypersonic flight at very high altitudes could offer a means to deploy nuclear weapons while being extremely difficult to stop, offering a compromise between the strategic flexibility of a bomber and the speed and responsiveness of a ballistic missile.
Upgrades high-speed bombers to a much faster, longer-ranged variant that operates at higher elevations, and is very difficult to shoot down."

"AWACS_NAME" LANG "AWACS"
"AWACS_DESC" LANG "Ground-based radar was crucial for detecting enemy aircraft and providing advance warning for air defences and air superiority fighters, but had obvious limitations in that it was confined to the ground, meaning it could only provide warning for a fixed area. Once aircraft and radar technology evolved to a certain point, the idea of using heavy aircraft designated as radar carriers to provide early warning was quickly put into practice. Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft, colloquially known as AWACS (for airborne warning and control system) are generally based on commercial aircraft and serve as a control center for airborne units, thanks to their powerful radars which can identify enemy aircraft and missile threats from hundreds of kilometers away.
AWACS can detect aircraft and enemy units from far away, and can be upgraded to detect ballistic missiles with the appropriate over-horizon radar technology.
Also adds radar to naval helicopters to detect units from further away."

"Spy_Plane_NAME" LANG "Spy Planes"
"Spy_Plane_DESC" LANG "Aircraft in the military had their debut in WWI doing reconnaissance and observation missions, but the advent of jet aircraft decades later would create a new world of potential for aerial reconnaissance. A new breed of extremely specialized aircraft, colloquially known as spy planes, was developed for the role. These planes, equipped with little more than a suite of cameras, are designed to fly over enemy territory at extreme altitudes and take photographs to determine the location and movements of enemy assets. Early spy planes were almost invulnerable to enemy air defences and radar by sheer virtue of how high they flew, but as air defences advanced, spy planes adopted extreme speed as a defence mechanism, setting world records in the process.
Unlocks Spy Planes, which are hosted by specialized airbases. Spy Planes can fly over enemy territory to identify enemy units, can't be targeted with guns, can only be detected by units with strong radars with pulse-doppler technology or better, are harder to find, and are very difficult to shoot down.

"Heavy_Airframe_1_DESC" LANG "The development of efficient, relatively low-powered jet engines with high bypass ratios meant that large non-combatant aircraft like cargo planes and commercial airliners could enjoy increased speed and performance over their older prop-driven counterparts. The military readily realized this, and jet-powered transport and strategic lift aircraft quickly entered the scene.
Increases the speed, range and survivability of AWACS and transport planes."

"Heavy_Airframe_2_NAME" LANG "High Efficiency Heavy Airframes"
"Heavy_Airframe_2_DESC" LANG "Although the general layout of most heavy aircraft would remain more or less the same, they would continue to be improved over time. The speed, range and maximum takeoff weights of these aircraft would be gradually increased through incremental improvements as they slowly evolved into more optimized designs. Increased engine power and efficiency, lighter materials, weight-reduction measures and improved aerodynamics would improve the flight characteristics of these aircraft, while improved avionics would make them easier to fly.
Further increases the range, speed and survivability of AWACS and transport planes."

"Heavy_Airframe_3_NAME" LANG "Blended Wing Airframes"
"Heavy_Airframe_3_DESC" LANG "New blended-wing heavy aircraft designs aim to maximize the useful volume of an aircraft’s footprint by having the wings and body blended, so that the wings effectively become part of the fuselage. Blended wing aircraft offer an advantage in that they can potentially carry more fuel or cargo while having the same relative dimensions. This translates to increased range and endurance when applied to large military aircraft, as well as the potential to make them smaller and more survivable without detracting from their capabilities.
Further increases the range, speed and survivability of heavy aircraft."


"Helicopter_1_NAME" LANG "Helicopters"
"Helicopter_1_DESC" LANG "After helicopters became a viable means of transportation, their potential for military applications was quickly realized. Despite the shortcomings of early helicopters, the ability to land without a runway and hover in mid-air made them invaluable as a means to rapidly move personnel and equipment, as well as in specialized roles like anti-submarine warfare and close air support. The new capabilities offered by helicopters would revolutionize warfare on land, in the air and at sea.
Unlocks Spec-Ops Helicopters and Naval Helicopters."


"Helicopter_2_NAME" LANG "Turboshaft Helicopters"
"Helicopter_2_DESC" LANG "Most early helicopters were limited by their large, cumbersome piston engines, which were poorly suited for the role. As a result, the first helicopters were slow, inefficient and underpowered. The adoption of more powerful turboshaft engines allowed helicopters to fly faster, farther and with more weight, which greatly increased their potential in all of their roles. Being able to carry more equipment allowed for upgrades in other areas, like weapons, sensors and protection. That, along with the addition of a variety of other design improvements, made the following generation of helicopters far more capable, with some designs being reused and upgraded for decades after their introduction. Furthermore, although the concept of strapping weapons to helicopters was not at all new, the first purpose-built attack helicopters would emerge shortly after turboshaft designs became commonplace.
Unlocks Attack Helicopters, for Army Bases, Makeshift Airbases, and Forward Operating Bases. Increases the speed, range and survivability of helicopters."

"Helicopter_3_NAME" LANG "Enhanced Helicopters"
"Helicopter_3_DESC" LANG "In order to survive in increasingly dangerous environments, helicopters gradually became heavier to accommodate more powerful sensors, countermeasures and weapons, and the increased weight would have to be offset with increased engine power and lift. Twin-engine designs became ubiquitous and older designs gradually adopted more rotor blades, as well as other improvements like system redundancy, ‘glass cockpits’ and composite materials. As a result, helicopters became faster overall, but also much more capable in other terms.
Further increases the speed, range and survivability of helicopters."

"Helicopter_4_NAME" LANG "Advanced Helicopters"

All of these are necessary to provide the immense amount of power and lift needed to survive on a battlefield full of anti-air threats like shoulder-fired missiles, anti-aircraft guns, SAMs and more. Improved avionics, advanced sensor suites and increased agility and speed to evade enemy fire are all crucial to ensure that helicopters can survive in high-threat environments.
Further increases the speed, range and survivability of helicopters."

"Helicopter_5_NAME" LANG "Unconventional Rotorcraft"
"Helicopter_5_DESC" LANG "There are innate limitations on what a helicopter is capable of. Improving their engine power indefinitely isn’t a viable solution since the tips of the rotor blades can reach the speed of sound which creates dramatic complications. In order to increase the top speeds and performance of helicopters, the next step was to transform them into something entirely different. Tiltrotor aircraft can angle their rotors to provide vertical or forward thrust, allowing them to effectively change from a helicopter to a fixed-wing aircraft in mid-flight, which dramatically increases their top speed and range. This comes with certain trade-offs like increased maintenance and training requirements, as well as certain technical challenges specific to tiltrotors. However, the vast increase in speed and range over helicopters and the ability to hover and land where fixed-wing aircraft can’t, makes them much more suitable for conducting rapid, long-distance deployments than their conventional counterparts.
Dramatically increases the range and speed of helicopters, and improves their survivability."
 
"Interceptor_aircraft_NAME" LANG "Interceptor Aircraft"
"Interceptor_aircraft_DESC" LANG "Interceptors are aircraft that specialize in defeating large targets in long-range air-to-air combat. Although interceptors have a history dating back to the beginning of aerial warfare, the advent of powerful, high-altitude aircraft armed with nuclear weapons necessitated the development of more specialized and capable interceptors. The introduction of jet engines and long-range air-based radars and missiles allowed for the development of a new breed of interceptor aircraft, capable of covering incredible distances at extreme speeds and engaging enemy aircraft from miles away.
Interceptors are fast and very capable against other aircraft at long-range, but do poorly against enemy fighters that are close enough to attack. Use them defensively to quickly defeat enemy AWACS and bombers that stray into your territory. Advanced interceptors can also be equipped with ASATs."

"Jammers_DESC" LANG "Radio jamming is an electronic warfare technique where the operation of a radio transmitter or receiver is deliberately interfered with by an opposing transmitter, also known as a jammer. There are multiple ways to jam a radio (and by extension, radar) system, but the most basic ones involve overwhelming the receiver by broadcasting random noise so that it can’t properly interpret the information it’s meant to, whether that’s radio communications or radar targeting information or something else. The concept of radio and radar jamming can be traced back to the early days of radar, but making a jammer sophisticated enough to be competitive against military hardware, as well as compact and powerful enough to be mobile and effective at ranges that are useful in warfare, requires a fair amount of effort.

"Jammers_Mk2_NAME" LANG "SEAD/EW Aircraft"
"Jammers_Mk2_DESC" LANG "SEAD, which stands for Suppression of Enemy Air Defences, is a strategy and activity that seeks to undermine the effectiveness of enemy air defence networks by destroying radars and SAM sites as well as diminishing their ability to operate, both through electronic attack (i.e. jamming) and intimidation. Early attempts at this using aircraft were highly dangerous and often done on an ad-hoc basis, but the development of specialized aircraft and weapons would make it more feasible. Modified fighter and bomber aircraft equipped with electronic warfare suites and long-range anti-radiation missiles, which automatically home in on radar transmissions from SAMs and radar sites, were brought into service as a means of threatening enemy SAM capabilities from the air, making it far easier for friendly aircraft to operate. Needless to say, attacking anti-air sites with aircraft is a very dangerous mission, and EW aircraft are expensive and valuable assets, but effective SEAD operations can make it far easier to secure air superiority.

"Jammers_Mk3_NAME" LANG "DRFM Jamming Systems"
"Jammers_Mk3_DESC" LANG "Digital Radio Frequency Memory Jamming, or DRFM jamming, is a jamming technique that involves cloning an enemy radar signal in order to mislead the radar transmitting it. In DRFM jamming, the opposing radar sends a radar signal to the jammer, which digitally 'memorizes' that radar signal. With the jammer now having knowledge of the enemy radar signal, it can accurately retransmit that signal back to the enemy and modulate it so that the enemy radar receives false information. Because the transmitted signal closely matches that which the radar put out, the radar can't discern between which information is real and which is the result of jamming, making DRFM jamming harder to recognize and harder to overcome. In essence, DRFM jamming allows jammers to fool enemy radars by broadcasting their own signal back at them, but modifying it slightly in order to mislead them and present them with false targeting information, making it more effective at fooling enemy radar than older techniques.
Increases the effective range of jammers on enemy radar systems."

Combined with improved electronics, better jamming techniques and other yet undisclosed technology, next generation jammers will be even more powerful and more capable of attacking a wider spectrum of frequencies at once, making them very difficult to counteract and resist by all but the most advanced and discerning radar systems.

Given the primitive guidance systems of these new threats, the most practical and readily developable solution to counteract them was to create ways to confuse their guidance systems and make them miss their targets. Radar-reflecting chaff was developed shortly after the proliferation of radar as a means of giving off confusing and misleading radar returns, and was quickly adapted into a countermeasure against radar-seeking missiles once they became prominent. Infrared decoys were also rapidly developed as a way to confuse heatseeking missiles by giving off multiple false heat-signatures. By misleading and confusing the guidance systems of radar and heatseeking weapons, aircraft and surface ships would improve their chances of survival by minimizing their chances of being hit, or causing the weapons to explode at the wrong time or in the wrong place and do minimal damage.

"Electronic_Counters_Mk2_NAME" LANG "Active Missile Interference"
"Electronic_Counters_Mk2_DESC" LANG "The introduction of more advanced missiles designed to defeat earlier electronic countermeasures like simple chaff and flares necessitated even better protection systems. Using active targeted radar and infrared emitters, it's possible to actively manipulate and confuse the guidance system of an enemy homing missile and mislead it into missing its target. Sudden randomized pulses of energy are sent out and received by the enemy weapon's seeker head, giving it conflicting information about the location and vector of its target which disorients it and may cause it to miss. Enemy missiles that are directly guided by their launcher can also be actively jammed, and if they are unable to receive commands and correct their course, they are very unlikely to hit their mark. Although chaff and flares are still useful, directly and actively attempting to interfere with the guidance system of a weapon is even more likely to fool it and foil an attack.

"Electronic_Counters_Mk3_NAME" LANG "Advanced Chaff and IR Decoys"
"Electronic_Counters_Mk3_DESC" LANG "As missile guidance became smarter and smarter, electronic countermeasures would have to become more sophisticated and illusive to successfully confuse enemy missiles and throw them off course. Improvements to the shape and composition of chaff would allow it to linger in the air for longer periods of time and produce greater, more confusing radar returns. Additionally, broadcasting a jamming signal directly into a cloud of chaff can create a large, convincing false target for missiles. New countermeasure patterns and dispersion strategies were also developed to defeat tracking algorithms, by being more random and harder to discern, as well as attempting to fool the guidance system in a number of ways at multiple points along its course. Countermeasures for other types of guidance other than just infrared and radar would also be developed, and would evolve to a point where even relatively small systems could be protected, diminishing the effectiveness of enemy homing missiles as a whole. Although some missiles will still be able to bypass these countermeasures, advanced ECM will greatly improve the survivability of units threatened by guided missiles.

Lasers that are powerful enough to blind or disable (but not destroy) incoming missiles have the potential to offer a relatively lightweight anti-missile active protection system for small platforms like combat aircraft. Although it's not a perfect defence and these weapons may not be able to always dazzle enemy missiles, a successfully damaged and blinded missile is far, far less likely to score a kill than one that's in working order. Combining active blinding with other passive methods like chaff and flares will make it much harder for incoming missiles to hit their mark, but it doesn't guarantee immunity, especially against multiple sufficiently advanced weapons.

A surface-to-air missile, or SAM, is a land or sea-based system that is designed to fire guided missiles at airborne targets and destroy them. Early SAMs existed either as very short-ranged systems that relied on infrared (heatseeking) homing built into the missile itself, or as large, complex, multi-faceted radar-guided systems where a dedicated radar would have to continuously mark the target, and then the radar-guided SAM would home in on the radar signature and destroy it. Early SAMs were big, cumbersome and a little slow to react, but they revolutionized the aerial battlespace and effectively turned high-altitude combat sorties into a death sentence wherever SAMs could be found. While ground-based anti-air weapons were present from the start, the arrival of SAMs in particular would be the catalyst for reshaping the concept of aerial warfare.

Conventional midcourse interceptors can be produced en masse and do not contaminate the area they explode over, making them generally more flexible than nuclear ABMs, but less effective against massed warheads than high-yield ABMs. Although conventional ABMs come with fewer caveats than their nuclear counterparts, they won't provide the same protection as a high-yield ABM, and the most you should expect them to do is buy you some time before they're overwhelmed!
Unlocks conventional midcourse ABMs, which replace neutron-kill ABMs and do not require production or produce fallout."

"ABM_Mk2_NAME" LANG "Hit-To-Kill Midcourse ABM"

Eventually, once missile guidance systems and tracking radars became advanced enough, hit-to-kill midcourse interceptors could be developed. Rather than relying on conventional explosives or the overwhelming force of a nuclear blast, this generation of interceptors would directly smash into the incoming warhead (which is already moving towards the ground at upwards of Mach 20) and cause it to violently break apart on impact without detonating properly. Although kinetic interceptors will reliably score kills if they can connect, given the incredible speeds involved and the small size of the targets, scoring a direct hit is a daunting and very expensive challenge.

Although accuracy was always the limiting factor for midcourse ABM performance, improved booster and steering systems would also be necessary to give the interceptors the range and finesse they needed to reliably make the flight adjustments to get on a collision course with their targets.

As ABM technology improves, it may be possible to have the launch vehicle release several kill vehicles at once which can be tasked to different targets, effectively allowing a single ABM to intercept multiple threats and defeat MIRVs. Concurrently, with the advent of hypersonic glide vehicles, the ability to predict the trajectory of an incoming threat and rapidly modify the course of the kill vehicle is an emerging requirement. Advanced tracking systems, complex probability-based target-motion analysis, and a sophisticated method of rapidly relaying targeting corrections, will all be necessary for ABMs to plot a course and intercept advanced threats. Similarly, vast improvements to the agility and flight characteristics of the interceptors themselves will also be necessary to ensure that they can physically make the maneuvers needed to collide with their targets.

Hybrid guidance systems featuring wide-spectrum active radar in tandem with optical, thermal or other forms of tracking will allow these SAMs to acquire and attack targets, including stealth ones, from farther away and with greater accuracy. The flight performance of the missiles themselves will also have to improve dramatically, in order to defeat threats like hypersonic weapons, aircraft carrying massed stand-off munitions, and high-altitude systems like reconnaissance UAVs.

Ballistic missiles travel at extreme speeds and are difficult to detect without specialized equipment, giving little time to respond to one. Since preemptively destroying the enemy’s ability to launch missiles is not always practical, it was clear there needed to be a means of destroying the missiles in-flight. Long-range systems would be developed to intercept incoming missiles in the midcourse stage of their flight in outer-space. Because of the inherent difficulty of engaging a small, extremely fast object at an extreme range and altitude, the lack of precision in these early systems meant that they had to be armed with nuclear warheads to be effective. Early ABM designs relied on a neutron-kill system, where the neutron radiation released by a nuclear explosion would contaminate and nullify incoming nuclear warheads.
Unlocks (nuclear) Midcourse ABM systems. Basic Neutron-Kill ABMs are liable to contaminate the environment with radioactive fallout, but can be produced in large numbers.

In order to be effective, terminal ABM systems need a high-degree of precision, advance warning, and incredible acceleration characteristics to intercept and destroy their targets before they can hit. Operating at relatively short ranges gives terminal defence systems a limited window to operate, making them best used as a last-resort to protect priority point targets like major cities or military installations. Because of their short, in-atmosphere operating ranges, they can discern between decoys (which are less dense and fall more slowly in air) and genuine targets. They're very effective within their range, but can't defeat multiple warheads at once, and should be used along with midcourse ABM systems for maximum effectiveness.

Spy satellites were developed to orbit over enemy territory and gather intelligence, initially by taking extremely high-altitude photographs. Early spy satellites produced low-quality photos on film that had to be dropped from space and manually retrieved, making it a cumbersome and extremely expensive process that offered information that was difficult to interpret. Still, spy satellites were invaluable as they could see what nobody else could, and could identify major enemy installations with little risk.
Satellites orbit around the planet in a fixed path and can only be attacked with specialized anti-satellite weapons, making them much less vulnerable but much less controllable than other systems. Early spy satellites will only detect land units, do not have the reaction-time needed to reliably report naval units and will not provide accurate targeting information.

This hypothetical system had advantages in that it could engage missiles in the midcourse and boost phases of their trajectories, well before they were close to hitting their targets. Because these lasers would operate in space, they would require less energy to be effective since they would not be diminished by the atmosphere.

Early outer space monitoring worked by identifying orbiting objects, cataloging their characteristics and then modelling their predicted orbits, rather than actively tracking them at all times. As a result, the arrival of new objects or changes in the orbits of cataloged assets might go unnoticed for days, weeks or even months before a change was noted.

"Chemical_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Basic Chemical Weapons"
"Chemical_Weapons_DESC" LANG "A chemical weapon is a device that uses chemical agents in order to injure, kill or otherwise incapacitate living targets. Most early chemical weapons were asphyxiants or blister agents, which worked by inflaming the target's skin, eyes and airways, producing an intense burning sensation and quite often, suffocation from lung damage. Chemical weapons can be used as an area denial weapon by contaminating a target area and adversely affecting anyone who enters without proper protection. Chemical weapons have been used as early as WWI, mostly in the form of repurposed and modified commercial chemicals, but only a few nations have seriously pursued a chemical warfare program since then.
Chemical weapons can't physically destroy military hardware, but they can be deployed against army divisions, army bases, combat engineers, forward operating bases, and of course, civilians, to inflict heavy casualties. Units exposed to chemical weapons will be slowed down signficantly. However, chemical weapons are difficult to control and will inflict considerable collateral damage, often on the unit deploying them. They are best used against massed enemy groups and away from friendly cities to quickly dispatch enemy forces.

Rather than relying on the target suffocating by attacking the lungs, these weapons can directly and rapidly induce rapid organ failure and death on their own, making them considerably more dangerous than earlier chemical weapons. Improvements to the delivery and dispersion systems will also make it easier to spread the agents more efficiently and inflict more casualties.

Certain agents can also be absorbed through skin contact, rather than needing to be ingested or inhaled. Some weapons have even been designed to defeat chemical defence measures by slowly dissolving the protective equipment that would normally protect someone from exposure.

"Biological_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Basic Biological Weapons"

Since the active pathogens used in biological weapons are capable of self-replicating and spreading from infected individuals to new hosts, they can have a very long-lasting and widespread effect. This may cause them to spread and inflict casualties beyond the initial target, creating heavy collateral damage and sometimes putting the initial attacker at risk.
Biological weapons are not as destructive as nuclear weapons and will produce fewer initial casualties. They are also incapable of physically destroying military hardware. However, deploying them against a city will cause an outbreak of disease, which will slowly kill off a portion of the population. This effect will also quickly spread to other cities that are within a certain radius of the attack, including the attacker's. They can also be used against army divisions to inflict casualties and physically slow down their advance. Biological weapons are quite simple compared to nuclear weapons, and do not require fissile material to produce. This allows them to be built at high efficiency immediately.

Improving the storage and deployment systems for bioweapons will be necessary to utilize more effective diseases, as well as ensure that the pathogens are still highly contagious and virulent upon deployment. The availability of stronger biological agents, combined with improved weaponization, deployment and dispersal methods, allows for the creation of biological weapons that are deadlier and more effective as a whole.

Thanks to improved dispersion systems and more sophisticated epidemiological models, bioweapons can now target specific areas and infrastructure within cities, allowing for attacks specifically tailored to maximize exposure and long-distance transmission. Taking further measures to protect the pathogens before they're deployed to their targets will help maximize exposure during the attack and spur rapid infections, resulting in a critical mass of casualties that can more easily cascade into a large-scale outbreak. Perhaps most threateningly though, the genetics of the pathogens themselves can be altered to make them more suitable as weapons. As a result, biological weapons are now deadlier, more infectious and even more capable of wreaking havoc.

Chemical weapons could be engineered to be even more toxic, dispersed more easily, longer-lived and harder to decontaminate. Hypothetical genetically engineered bioweapons could potentially be far more contagious and deadly than any disease in history, and have even been cited as posing a human extinction risk. Creating and weaponizing such agents could lead to weapons capable of unprecedented destruction.
Upgrades chemical weapons to use Novichok-2000, which will inflict even more casualties and is extremely long-lived.

"Sonar_Mk2_NAME" LANG "Improved Sonar"
"Sonar_Mk2_DESC" LANG "Sonar (SOnic Navigation and Ranging) is a method of detecting objects by reflecting sound waves and analysing their returns. Sonar plays a crucial role in submarine warfare as it is the most practical way to detect objects underwater, and is both the best way to find submarines, and the best way for submarines to find other warships. Advancements in transducer technology and the invention of computerized signal processing allow sonar systems to detect quieter sounds from further away and better discriminate between genuine contacts and ambient noise. Both of these factors serve to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of sonar systems.
Sonar is crucial as it is necessary to locate and attack submerged enemy submarines, and it is also the only means your own submarines will have of finding other submarines and warships from a distance. The ability to use and counter submarines effectively is very dependent on sonar as a result.

"EMP_Defence_NAME" LANG "Basic EMP Shielding"
"EMP_Defence_DESC" LANG "When a nuclear weapon explodes, it creates an electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, which can disrupt electronic equipment. The EMP effects of nuclear weapons were predicted even before the very first tests were performed, and in fact the equipment at those tests were shielded accordingly. Electronics can be shielded from EMPs by either encasing them with a metal electrical shield to absorb the current, or by hardening the individual components in the electronics that are most likely to be damaged. Protecting the most crucial and vulnerable military electronics from EMPs will minimize the downtime spent repairing them and allow many of them to keep operating, albeit at an impaired capacity. Civilian assets, however, will still be extremely vulnerable.
Without this technology, many units will be completely stunned when attacked by an EMP and aircraft will crash instantly. Be sure to invest in this if you ever suspect your enemies will develop EMP weapons!
Reduces the severity and duration of EMP effects on military hardware."

"EMP_Defence_Mk2_NAME" LANG "Comprehensive EMP Shielding"
"EMP_Defence_Mk2_DESC" LANG "Improved EMP shielding techniques, a degree of system redundancy and a greater emphasis on protecting and hardening sensitive components will make it possible to have military assets effectively invulnerable to EMPs, or at least at a state where the effects are negligible or easily dealt with. With this technology, military assets will be very well protected or outright invulnerable against EMP effects. Civilian infrastructure however, will still be largely susceptible and suffer serious productivity losses.
Greatly reduces the severity and duration of EMP effects on military hardware. High-cost systems will not be affected by EMPs at all."

"EMP_Defence_Mk3_NAME" LANG "Civil EMP Preparedness"
"EMP_Defence_Mk3_DESC" LANG "Although individual electrical components are relatively easy to shield, protecting an entire power grid is a far, far more complicated and demanding endeavor. Attempting to shield the entire power grid would be untenable as almost every component, including power lines, can be affected by an EMP and would have to be shielded, which is not practically feasible. Taking measures to shield the most important and difficult-to-replace infrastructure, as well as planning a surplus of replacement parts, will make it easier to restore and repair the electrical grid in the wake of an EMP attack. Although the effects will still be severe, they won’t be felt for as long.
Shortens the duration that cities will be affected by EMPs."

"EMP_Defence_Mk4_NAME" LANG "Advanced Civil EMP Shielding"
"EMP_Defence_Mk4_DESC" LANG "The advent of new shielding materials and systems will make it economical and practical to protect more and more devices from EMPs. The adoption of decentralized power generation through the widespread use of emergency generators, solar panels, and other alternative energy sources, will keep more of the electrical grid functioning after an attack and allow it to come back online piece by piece even if major powerplants are affected. This will allow more infrastructure to keep operating and reduce the time needed to fix the damage. Although considerable disruptions will still be inevitable, the civilian economy will be in a much better position to continue operating in the wake of an EMP attack with these measures and technologies in place.

Educating the public on how to protect themselves during an attack and how to prepare for nuclear fallout will reduce the initial number of casualties, and advance emergency planning will provide a timely response to prevent further losses and restore order. The use of an emergency broadcast system will give citizens a degree of prior warning so they can seek shelter, rather than be caught off-guard in the open and make sure they know what they need to do to maximize their chances of surviving.

Although a nuclear blast is very similar to an upscaled conventional explosion, it also produces nuclear fallout and causes radiation poisoning, which is often poorly understood and difficult to treat. Chemical weapon injuries also require very specific treatment and antidotes, and casualties exposed to contagious bioweapons must be treated carefully to protect others from being infected. Making medicine for WMD victims publicly accessible and preparing first-responders and medical care teams with the training and supplies they need to properly treat casualties will help to ensure that more civilians survive and recover from their injuries. Although even optimistically, the healthcare system will be hard-pressed to withstand a major WMD attack, these tools will be invaluable to whatever is left of it after the fact.

The internet also allows everyone to have an easily accessible repository of information that can help them survive in a nuclear war, which will improve their odds further. It will take time and effort to harden the information infrastructure enough to still be somewhat reliable in the wake of a nuclear attack, as well as leverage it properly to inform the public, but doing so will ensure that everyone has access to the information they need to maximize their chances.

"Survival_Boost_6_DESC" LANG "The logistics and preparations needed to shelter thousands of people from the effects of nuclear blasts and the ensuing radiation is no easy feat, but it is possible, provided a tremendous amount of funding and support. Massive hardened underground shelters can be constructed for the public and furnished with the facilities needed to support huge groups of survivors, complete with amenities like independent power generation and electricity, clean water, food supplies, sleeping accommodations and sanitation. Building and maintaining these shelters would take a substantial amount of time, planning and resources, but they would provide civilians who are unable to evacuate with the most ironclad chance at survival available. This infrastructure can also be repurposed to aid the civil power in other disasters as well, such as tornadoes, uncontrollable wildfires, and any other situation where thousands of people could find themselves suddenly displaced and in need of shelter and other necessities. Other measures, like hardening infrastructure like bridges and underground transit, and having clear and well-coordinated evacuation, response and contingency plans, will help prepare the civilian population for the absolute worst to come.

While previous acts of sabotage or terrorism were limited to whatever damage could be done with a relatively meager explosive payload and whatever secondary effects it could achieve, the advent of nuclear weapons and other WMDs suddenly meant that a single discreetly delivered weapon could potentially kill thousands. The risk of a nuclear terror attack by a rogue actor is low due to the complications of constructing a functional nuclear weapon without immense funding and resources, but hypothetically, a nuclear-armed state could discreetly deliver a nuclear payload to an enemy target and detonate it. Doing so would not be an easy feat, as the delivery vehicle in question would have to successfully bypass the border into the target country, and then maneuver to a target location without being detected. The vehicle itself would also have to be capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, which tend to be rather heavy and potentially difficult to conceal effectively. The issue of having the delivery team deploy the weapon and escape the blast radius is an entirely different issue, and although arrangements to exfiltrate might be possible, sacrifices will likely be necessary.

Taking the measures necessary and forging the appropriate documents to ensure that such a vehicle can somehow bypass or evade opposing security forces will require some creative innovations. Smuggling a high-yield nuclear weapon into an enemy country is not impossible, but it will take a great deal of effort and planning to successfully devise a way to do it, especially more than once.

Ordinary uranium doesn’t react to neutrons readily enough to explode properly under ordinary conditions, whereas highly enriched (also known as weapons-grade) uranium or plutonium, will. By bombarding natural uranium-238 with neutrons, small quantities of it can be transformed into plutonium, which can then be separated and efficiently used in nuclear weapons. Creating the proper apparatuses to do this efficiently will make it possible to transform more ordinary uranium into weapons-grade material, making it easier and cheaper to produce nuclear warheads.

The fissile material has to be separated from the rest in order to have it in a concentration where it’s viable as a fuel source for a nuclear reactor or weapon. Since the two isotopes have very slightly different masses, it’s possible to separate the two using a gas centrifuge, producing depleted material as well as enriched material that can be used in nuclear warheads.

However, plutonium-239 is liable to absorb another neutron and become plutonium-240, which contaminates the fuel supply and makes it less potent. To maximize the efficiency of plutonium enrichment, it's important to expose the uranium sample to just enough neutrons to convert it to plutonium-239, without having excess neutrons to produce plutonium-240. Doing so requires breeder reactors that can quickly change out the material they're enriching to avoid excessive neutron exposure. Developing improved breeder reactor designs with this capability will lessen the amount of plutonium-240 produced and result in purer plutonium fuel sources, and by extension, make it cheaper and easier to produce nuclear weapons.

"Weapon_Modernization_NAME" LANG "Weapon Modernization"
"Weapon_Modernization_DESC" LANG "Prior to the Cold War, most mainstay infantry weapons were either submachine guns or rifles chambered for full-power cartridges. Although neither type of weapon would be completely phased out from military use, they were both largely supplanted by assault rifles. Assault rifles fire intermediate cartridges and are generally relatively accurate and controllable when fired in full-auto, making them versatile weapons suitable for most situations. Concurrently, while most nations transitioned to assault rifles, their other weapons, like tank guns and artillery, would also enjoy incremental improvements, namely a trend towards standardized calibers and more powerful ammunition.
Transitioning to more effective weapons will allow army divisions and special forces to damage and destroy their targets faster. Don't forget to invest in better optics if you want to spot and attack your enemies from farther away!

"Improved_Army_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Upgraded Mixed Weapons"
"Improved_Army_Weapons_DESC" LANG "The first generation of assault rifles had shortcomings like weight and reliability issues and had room for ergonomic improvements. Upgraded models of these weapons would quickly arrive, while a concurrent demand for other forms of firepower would lead to the introduction of relatively new or recently refined weapon concepts, like intermediate-caliber light machine guns, DMRs and grenade launchers. The increased presence of armoured vehicles on the battlefield due to widespread mechanization incentivized the creation of better anti-tank weapons, while the advent of helicopters spurred the development of shoulder-fired anti-air missiles. Naturally, other weapon systems like artillery and tank shells would also benefit from improved accuracy and improved ammunition.

"Enhanced_Army_Weapons_NAME" LANG "Modular and Smart Army Weapons"
"Enhanced_Army_Weapons_DESC" LANG "The basic design of an assault rifle is difficult to improve upon, as the concept of the weapon itself is extremely sound, and the roles that it cannot fulfill are generally performed by weapons with vastly different characteristics. As a result, while some small arms tried adopting radical new ideas like bullpup configurations, many simply became more ergonomic, modular and adaptable to their surroundings. Shortened weapons suitable for close-quarter battle like carbines and the first Personal Defence Weapon concepts would also start to garner interest as well. Heavier munitions like anti-tank missiles and artillery would leverage ever-increasing computing power, leading to the invention of the first top-attack missiles and smart artillery shells, making the battlefield a much more dangerous place for slow or exposed targets.

The demand was for weapons that were more capable of defeating modern body armour, while also more maneuverable in close quarters. As a result, armour piercing ammunition started to see widespread use, even being used in certain weapons as small as SMGs and handguns, and interest was renewed in heavier, larger caliber ammunition for service rifles. Carbines, bullpups and collapsible and folding stocks would become ubiquitous, while the realm of anti-tank weapons would see an increasing demand for armour-penetrating power, leading to smaller rifles and bigger rockets. The precision of other tactical ground-based weapons would also continue to improve, making them even more dangerous than before.

Effective ground reconnaissance allows armies and special forces to identify their targets from farther away and engage them earlier. Early night-vision and infrared imagers were big, cumbersome and had limited effectiveness, but they provided an advantage in finding enemy targets at night and in poor conditions. By sizing down these devices to a more manageable size and improving their performance, ground reconnaissance teams can use them to find enemy forces and precisely determine their positions. This increases the situational awareness of their parent unit and allows for more consistent and effective long-range attacks.

Armed, remote-controlled robots can supplement (but not replace) the ranks of regular infantry as expendable soldiers that can be tasked to do things that would be far too risky for humans to willingly or safely carry out. Having a sacrificable scapegoat for high-risk action is especially valuable for long-range patrols, where the risk of death or capture is especially high, as well as in regular combat situations. Integrated sensors and data fusion can also serve as a force-multiplier for those fighting alongside the robots, as they’ll be able to provide targeting data as they actively fight alongside their unit.

Explosions, shrapnel and gunfire all pose a serious threat, and before the advent of effective body armour, they would invariably spell serious injury or death. Some rudimentary protection, like improved helmets and flak jackets, can help protect soldiers from low-speed projectiles like shrapnel and grenade fragments, but will fail against more potent threats like gunfire. Improving their other equipment will allow soldiers to operate more effectively, and reduce their casualties simply by merit of making them better prepared to fight and more able to avoid being killed or injured.

Early metals were incapable of stopping gunfire while still being light enough to be practical to wear. However, improvements in metallurgy and armour design have resulted in hard ballistic armour inserts that are capable of surviving hits from full-power rifle ammunition with limited (but not zero) injury to the wearer. Now, gunshots that may have once meant certain death for the recipient, might be reduced to minor injuries like bruising or cracked ribs.

The idea is that when a bullet or fragment hits the liquid armour, it will rapidly thicken into a solid or near-solid, and absorb and dissipate the impact before rapidly returning to its normal liquid state. When used in conjunction with woven and hard armour, it provides additional protection while also being relatively lightweight and flexible.

This allows the wearer to potentially carry much more equipment, move faster, jump higher, and lift loads far heavier than they could unassisted. Extremely strong nanomaterials with tensile strength much higher than steel, have the potential to serve as the basis for extremely strong body armour, to the point where the limiting factor would be how much blunt trauma the wearer could absorb, rather than if the armour could be penetrated. A combination of the two could allow a person to greatly outperform an unequipped counterpart and withstand far more punishment. Although such a system would be extremely expensive, if it could be mass-produced, it would dramatically improve the capabilities of an infantry soldier.

"CBRN_Defence_1_NAME" LANG "Basic CBRN Defence"
"CBRN_Defence_1_DESC" LANG "CBRN stands for Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear, and CBRN defence seeks to miminize the effects of all of the above. Although chemical defence measures existed as early as 1915, the advent of nuclear weapons had serious implications for armies. Because armies tend to be large, dispersed and often in cover, the raw destructive power of nuclear weapons is often inefficient against army formations as a whole (yet undeniably effective against localized targets) but the threat of nuclear fallout creates new challenges. Although there’s no surviving a nuclear explosion at close range, personnel who aren't killed instantly can protect themselves from radiation, using respirators and specially-designed clothing which minimizes their exposure to hazardous materials and is easily decontaminated, very similarly to existing chemical defense equipment, but with emphasis on resisting radiation and offering full-body coverage.
Better CBRN Defense equipment will reduce the damage your army divisions, combat engineers and army bases will sustain from nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but not their survivability against conventional weapons. Invest in this technology if you're expecting chemical or bioweapon attacks, or if your strategy for nuclear war relies on armies!"

"CBRN_Defence_2_NAME" LANG "CBRN Countermeasures"
"CBRN_Defence_2_DESC" LANG "As the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction proliferated, increased emphasis would be placed on giving armies the means to survive them. CBRN Defence equipment would improve in its ergonomics and protective properties, but an increased emphasis would be placed on early warning and mitigating the effects of CBRN weapons directly. Chemical detection paper, geiger counters and antidotes for common chemical weapons would become standard-issue in environments where exposure to CBRN threats was expected. Improved systems for decontaminating CBRN-exposed equipment and personnel would also be developed. These improvements would serve to increase the military's capacity to survive and continue operating in CBRN environments, but of course, weapons of mass destruction are never forgiving, and heavy casualties were still expected.

"CBRN_Defence_3_NAME" LANG "Specialized CBRN Reconnaissance"
"CBRN_Defence_3_DESC" LANG "Increasingly potent chemical agents and the growing risk posed by tactical nuclear weapons, especially neutron bombs, spurred further developments in CBRN defence technology and doctrine. With the extreme lethality of modern nerve agents and the innate danger of radiation, the best defence is often to avoid or minimize exposure to the threats in the first place. Specialized CBRN reconnaissance vehicles would be developed specifically for the task of identifying chemical agents and evaluating the risk posed by radiological threats, which by extension would allow other units to be more prepared. Improved decontamination systems and ad-hoc CBRN specialist units would also aid in minimizing casualties in the event of a WMD strike, and also extend the longevity of CBRN equipment in a contaminated environment and ensure replacements were available.
Further increases the ability of army divisions, combat engineers, and army bases to withstand nuclear, chemical and biological weapons."

"CBRN_Defence_4_DESC" LANG "Throughout its evolution, all CBRN equipment has had a similar job and performed it in the same way. In essence, stopping the wearer from being exposed to radiation or toxic agents. CBRN defence revolves around exposure prevention, treatment, early warning and decontamination, and the methods for all of them have followed the same principles, only to be improved upon mainly with advances in chemistry and material science. Making CBRN gear more ergonomic, longer-lived and better-protecting will make it even more effective at preventing casualties, while the use of drones and unmanned ground vehicles in tandem with advanced detecting equipment will make it even easier to detect and identify CBRN threats, so they can be addressed even more efficiently.

Armies can travel over land and destroy any enemy units they come across. They can also move into enemy cities and occupy them, denying the enemy access to their economic output. Capturing cities also allows you to annex enemy territory. Sending an army to an army base will load it onto a transport plane so it can be deployed by air. Armies can also board landing ships and deploy by sea.
A historically commonplace yet reprehensible use for armies is to deliberately target civilians and destroy cities. Commanding an army to attack a city (rather than just moving to it) will cause the army to start razing the city to the ground.
